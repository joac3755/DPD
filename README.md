### Idea 16 - Learn AI gamify journey of understanding AI and learning how to use it.

## Concepts
### Concept:
We will create an APP/ a platform based around learning AI, we will make the app as a game, gamify it. Just like duolingo, making the journey for the user as fun and understandable as possible. Both children at 10 years old and elderly can use the app. It will include learning streaks, points, goals, scoreboards etc. All to create the most fun learning experience as pos-sible. 
Compared to other learning apps out there, our app will be interactive for the user, ensuring that they will actually have it in their hands. They will learn what AI is, but they will also learn what prompting is and so on.
The app will include functionalities like drag/drop, text-input and check boxes, making it gam-ified. 
Also the users will learn how they can actually use AI themselves, and the user experience could be evolving around the specific profile of the user (maybe they are 10 years old and just want to play with the app, or they are a 50 year old CEO wanting to understand AI in a finance perspective) - The user jouney will in this way be dynamic ensuring that the gamification of AI is targeted the user as good as possible.
In this way it will also give more relevant examples of AI, fx. Depending on the hobbies or the job type of the user.
